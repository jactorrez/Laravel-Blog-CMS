# Blog CMS built with Laravel

This is a fun project I worked on a couple months ago. In the end, I built a complete CRUD application, wherein I learned about the more advanced capabilities of Laravel. Building a blog CMS forced me to really grasp relational databases like MySQL, and though storing and grabbing a blog post from a database isn't that difficult, I also built and added a commenting and tagging system to the application.
